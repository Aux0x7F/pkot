					<h2>About Us</h2>
				</header>
				<div class="row">
					<p>Mobilize Tucson is a grassroots group working to empower Tucsonans, unite communities, and resist the erosion of our fundamental rights.<br><br>
					We started with a handful of us wanting to make a difference in Tucson and putting on a tiny 50501 protest of about 50 participants in early February. Our Second protest grew to roughly 400 people. On March 4th we held our third 50501 protest and were amazed we had so many show up and march with us to City Hall. Finally, on April 5th we held an event in partnership with Indivisible Tucson and Hands Off! We had over 20,000 Tucsonans come out to protest with us.</p>

						<h2>On Native Land</h2>
					</header>
				<div class="row">
					<p>Mobilize Tucson is a community-driven organization based in Tucson, Arizona, on the homelands of the Tohono O’odham Nation and the lands of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe.<br><br>
					We want to recognize and give respect to the Indigenous peoples who have lived and continue to live on this land. This land, originally inhabited thousands of years ago by the Hohokam people, is still home to the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the Tohono O’odham Nation, and many other Indigenous communities today.<br><br>
					For land acknowledgment to truly matter, it must be tied to action—and that’s one of the reasons why we are uniting together. To honor Tucson’s true history, culture, and all communities means recognizing and respecting that everywhere we step, is Indigenous land.<br><br>
					We honor the rights and responsibilities of Indigenous Peoples to steward and protect their lands and cultural legacies. We actively support Tribal-led preservation efforts and seek to foster deeper inclusion, consultation, and collaboration with Indigenous communities in all aspects of conservation and advocacy. This is going to be an evolving, breathing statement and we welcome feedback and input to help shape it as we learn and grow.</p>
